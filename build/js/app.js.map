Scenes with `duration == 0`:  \r\n\t\t *  Scenes that have no duration by definition have no ending. Thus the `end` event will never be fired.  \r\n\t\t *  When the trigger position of the scene is passed the events are always fired in this order:  \r\n\t\t *  `enter`, `start`, `progress` when scrolling forward  \r\n\t\t *  and  \r\n\t\t *  `progress`, `start`, `leave` when scrolling in reverse\r\n\t\t *  2. Scenes with `duration > 0`:  \r\n\t\t *  Scenes with a set duration have a defined start and end point.  \r\n\t\t *  When scrolling past the start position of the scene it will fire these events in this order:  \r\n\t\t *  `enter`, `start`, `progress`  \r\n\t\t *  When continuing to scroll and passing the end point it will fire these events:  \r\n\t\t *  `progress`, `end`, `leave`  \r\n\t\t *  When reversing through the end point these events are fired:  \r\n\t\t *  `enter`, `end`, `progress`  \r\n\t\t *  And when continuing to scroll past the start position in reverse it will fire:  \r\n\t\t *  `progress`, `start`, `leave`  \r\n\t\t *  In between start and end the `progress` event will be called constantly, whenever the progress changes.\r\n\t\t * \r\n\t\t * In short:  \r\n\t\t * `enter` events will always trigger **before** the progress update and `leave` envents will trigger **after** the progress update.  \r\n\t\t * `start` and `end` will always trigger at their respective position.\r\n\t\t * \r\n\t\t * Please review the event descriptions for details on the events and the event object that is passed to the callback.\r\n\t\t * \r\n\t\t * @method ScrollMagic.Scene#progress\r\n\t\t * @example\r\n\t\t * // get the current scene progress\r\n\t\t * var progress = scene.progress();\r\n\t\t *\r\n\t\t * // set new scene progress\r\n\t\t * scene.progress(0.3);\r\n\t\t *\r\n\t\t * @fires {@link Scene.enter}, when used as setter\r\n\t\t * @fires {@link Scene.start}, when used as setter\r\n\t\t * @fires {@link Scene.progress}, when used as setter\r\n\t\t * @fires {@link Scene.end}, when used as setter\r\n\t\t * @fires {@link Scene.leave}, when used as setter\r\n\t\t *\r\n\t\t * @param {number} [progress] - The new progress value of the scene `[0-1]`.\r\n\t\t * @returns {number} `get` -  Current scene progress.\r\n\t\t * @returns {Scene} `set` -  Parent object for chaining.\r\n\t\t */\r\n\t\tthis.progress = function (progress) {\r\n\t\t\tif (!arguments.length) { // get\r\n\t\t\t\treturn _progress;\r\n\t\t\t} else { // set\r\n\t\t\t\tvar\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdoUpdate = false,\r\n\t\t\t\t\toldState = _state,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tscrollDirection = _controller ? _controller.info(\"scrollDirection\") : 'PAUSED',\r\n\t\t\t\t\treverseOrForward = _options.reverse || progress >= _progress;\r\n\t\t\t\tif (_options.duration === 0) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t// zero duration scenes\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdoUpdate = _progress != progress;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t_progress = progress < 1 && reverseOrForward ? 0 : 1;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t_state = _progress === 0 ?
